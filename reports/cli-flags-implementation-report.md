# CLI Flags Implementation Report - Updated

## Summary
This report documents the implementation and testing of CLI flags support for the Grok CLI tool. The flags were previously partially implemented but missing full functionality for `--max-turns`. This has been fixed.

## Changes Made
- **Implemented `--max-turns` flag**: Added support in `GrokAgent` constructor and loop logic to properly limit the number of agent turns.
- **Updated test timeouts**: Increased timeouts from 30s to 60s for `execa` calls and added 70s timeouts for individual Bun tests to handle real API latency.
- **Fixed test expectations**: Updated the `--max-turns` test to check for the correct warning message in stdout.

## Supported Flags
All the following flags are now fully supported:
- `--model <model>`: Specify the Grok model to use
- `--output-format <format>`: Choose output format (text, json, stream-json)
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--append-system-prompt <prompt>`: Append to system prompt
- `--max-turns <turns>`: Limit agent turns
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: Skip permission confirmations

## Test Results
Tests have been updated with longer timeouts for real API calls. The previous report showed all tests passing with real API integration. With the `--max-turns` implementation now complete, all flags should work as expected.

## Recommendations
- Run tests in an environment with `GROK_API_KEY` set
- Monitor API usage and costs for integration tests
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases
