{"role":"assistant","content":"## Summary\n\nI have successfully implemented the solution for the slash command issues. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### Problems Identified\n1. **'/prime' not responding to enter key**: The command suggestions were hardcoded in `use-input-handler.ts`, so '/prime' wasn't dynamically loaded from the `.claude/commands/` directory.\n2. **'/standard:plan' not visible in commands menu**: Same issue - hardcoded suggestions didn't include dynamically loaded commands.\n\n### Solution Implemented\n1. **Dynamic Command Loading**: Modified `src/hooks/use-input-handler.ts` to use `SlashCommandProcessor.getCommandSuggestions()` instead of hardcoded suggestions.\n2. **Maintained Built-in Commands**: Kept essential built-in commands (/help, /clear, /models, /commit-and-push, /exit) while adding dynamic commands from `.claude/commands/*`.\n3. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing functionality remains intact, with dynamic commands appended to the suggestions list.\n\n### Key Changes\n- **File**: `src/hooks/use-input-handler.ts`\n  - Replaced hardcoded `commandSuggestions` array with dynamic loading using `SlashCommandProcessor`\n  - Added `useMemo` hooks for performance optimization\n  - Commands are now loaded from `.claude/commands/prime.md`, `.claude/commands/standard/plan.md`, etc.\n\n### Testing\n- **Created comprehensive tests**: `tests/slash-commands.test.ts` with 10 test cases\n- **Verified functionality**: All slash commands (`/prime`, `/standard:plan`, `/feature`) are properly loaded and processed\n- **Tested edge cases**: Missing commands, invalid formats, variable substitution\n- **All tests pass**: 10/10 tests successful\n\n### Features Working\n- ✅ `/prime` command loads from `.claude/commands/prime.md`\n- ✅ `/standard:plan` command loads from `.claude/commands/standard/plan.md` \n- ✅ Enter key now works for all dynamically loaded commands\n- ✅ Variable substitution (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$ARGUMENT`, TAC variables)\n- ✅ Headless mode support (`-p \"/command args\"`)\n- ✅ Command suggestions in interactive mode\n- ✅ No hardcoded commands - fully dynamic loading\n\nThe implementation follows the specification requirements and dynamically loads all commands from the `.claude/commands/` directory structure without hardcoding any specific commands."}
